2410 Battleship - Project3

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration?
    - We use a logical thought process on how the game should run and went step by step creating the methods as we went. We would then run the game, see if it was running as expected. If not we would then go back and refactor our code as needed to account for any logical flaws in the game.
    - We relied on how the game was running in the terminal up to the current method we were working on, as well as the information provided in iteration 3.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
    - Refactoring our larger methods to be more readable.
    - To get into iteration 4, more specifically the intelligent computer section.
    - Looking into how to test user input so we can have tests in our game class for every method. (Also update out game_spec to be more readable.)

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
    - We stuck soley to driver navigator. However, being a trio we had two navigators and one driver, and would rotate accordingly to spread out the work flow.
    - We generally had one navigator more focused on research if it was needed so there weren't so many people talking at once.
    - We also created a group calender to follow to make it easier for us to find work times outside of class hours because we are all in different time zones.
    - We did not move on until everyone was clear on the code that was in each method so we all had a good understanding of what was going on in each class.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
    - We would take all recomendations for what we should try, if it failed someone would explain why this would not work and then give their input on what they think we should do in order to have the code working, and the tests passing.
    - We talked about things outside of code that we struggled with and held each other accountable on making sure we each wokring on overcoming those struggles throughout this project.
